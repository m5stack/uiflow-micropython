"All data related to MQTT messages is encoded as bytes. This includes both"
" message content AND topic names (even though MQTT spec states that topic"
" name is UTF-8 encoded). The reason for this is simple: what is received "
"over network socket is binary data (bytes) and it would require extra "
"step to convert that to a string, spending memory on that. Note that this"
" applies only to topic names (because they can be both sent and "
"received). Other parameters specified by MQTT as UTF-8 encoded (e.g. "
"ClientID) are accepted as strings."

"Subscribed messages are delivered via a callback. This is to avoid using "
"a queue for subscribed messages, as otherwise they may be received at any"
" time (including when client expects other type of server response, so "
"there're 2 choices: either deliver them immediately via a callback or "
"queue up until an \"expected\" response arrives). Note that lack of need "
"for a queue is delusive: the runtime call stack forms an implicit queue "
"in this case. And unlike explicit queue, it's much harder to control. "
"This design was chosen because in a common case of processing subscribed "
"messages it's the most efficient. However, if in subscription callback, "
"new messages of QoS>0 are published, this may lead to deep, or infinite "
"recursion (the latter means an application will terminate with "
"``RuntimeException``)."
