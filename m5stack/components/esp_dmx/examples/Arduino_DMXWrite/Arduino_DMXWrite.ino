  DMX Write

  This sketch allows you to write DMX data to a DMX listener using a standard
  DMX shield, such SparkFun ESP32 Thing Plus DMX to LED Shield. This sketch was
  made for the Arduino framework!

/* First, lets define the hardware pins that we are using with our ESP32. We
  need to define which pin is transmitting data and which pin is receiving data.
  DMX circuits also often need to be told when we are transmitting and when we
  are receiving data. We can do this by defining an enable pin. */

/* Make sure to double-check that these pins are compatible with your ESP32!
  Some ESP32s, such as the ESP32-WROVER series, do not allow you to read or
  write data on pins 16 or 17, so it's always good to read the manuals. */

/* Next, lets decide which DMX port to use. The ESP32 has either 2 or 3 ports.
  Port 0 is typically used to transmit serial data back to your Serial Monitor,
  so we shouldn't use that port. Lets use port 1! */

/* Now we want somewhere to store our DMX data. Since a single packet of DMX
  data can be up to 513 bytes long, we want our array to be at least that long.
  This library knows that the max DMX packet size is 513, so we can fill in the
  array size with `DMX_PACKET_SIZE`. */

  /* Now we will install the DMX driver! We'll tell it which DMX port to use,
    what device configuration to use, and what DMX personalities it should have.
    If you aren't sure which configuration to use, you can use the macros
    `DMX_CONFIG_DEFAULT` to set the configuration to its default settings.

    any DMX personalities. */
